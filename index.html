<p>We know in the future that all things that we know today will be extremily diffrent, like we'll having robots <b>new</b> special car, new buildings, automatic taxis and much more. We all have hear about the robots conquer over the world some people thinks that this scenario is not reall and is only made to scare people. </p>

<h1 class="ROBOTS">ROBOTS</h1>

<p>Scientists are working on the IA intelligence and specific on the robots, scientists wants to make robots smarter than humans</p>

<h3 class="robot1"> Types of robots.</h3>
<p> There are various types of robots,their are some types of robots bellow: </p>
<section class="p1">
<p><b>1) Exploration robots.</b></p>
<p><b>2) Îœedical robots.</b></p>
<p><b>3) Aerospace robots.</b></p>
<p><b>4) Aquatic robots</b></p>

<p><b class="b2">2) </b>Second robots in the category we have a very important robot, <b>the medical robot,</b> medical robots are basically the robots that safe many people lifes, it is the same think like surgeons BUT for automatic. This robots are have their own exoskeleton and their own (hands). This robots are one of the most useful robots in my opinion.</p>

<p><b class="b3">3) </b>Okay, now lets move on the third category in the <b>Aerospace robots.</b> Aerospace robots are very important too but for the exploration and for the military, do not worry I will talk about them. First this robots can not go under the water as like the Exploration robots, the Aerospace robots are automatics too and can fly, go on the ground and more. Second this robots are useful for the military to raid bases or find hidden enemies and it used more like drones.</p>

<p><b class="b4">4)</b> <b>Aquatic robots</b> are a vast unexplored field of robotics, Each design is assured to be unique, They can test any environment from a local pond, a bucket of water or a swimming pool, They can move underwater, They are inspired by fish and they use their fin-like actuators to maneuver in the water, Underwater Crawling robots are a marine version of land-based robots, They either roll on wheels or walk under water, if waterproofing is taken care, these robots can be easily designed and built.</p>
<h3> Disclaimer </h3>
<p><b>Of course</b> there are more thinks that anyone can write in a presentation about the future, but I select the category of the robots, I wish that you like my presentation, and I wish to make you more intersting about the future.<b> And thanks to my great teacher for make me know all of this things.</b></p>
